Click or tap the layer icon button to show the Layer Display Settings panel. In the Layer Display Settings panel, you can turn on/off the layer that is superimposed on the map. Precipitation layer, Fireworks layer and Live Cameras layer are available. Click or tap the “x” button in the top right corner of the panel, or click or tap outside the panel to close the panel.

Click or tap the Precipitation layer button to turn the precipitation animation on or off (the outer frame of the icon is shown in light blue when it is on). Based on real-time weather information, 8 levels of precipitation intensity are displayed in 3D animation in 1km mesh units.

Click or tap the Fireworks layer button to turn the fireworks animation on or off (the outer frame of the icon is shown in light blue when it is on). The fireworks animation will appear at a specific location on the map at a scheduled date and time.

Click or tap on the Live Cameras layer button to toggle the display of the live camera buttons on and off (the outer frame of the icon is shown in light blue when it is on). Clicking or tapping on the live camera buttons on the map will zoom in on the location and show the live camera video being broadcast from the same viewpoint. The video is transmitted in real time, but there is a delay of a few tens of seconds, so the actual train tends to appear slightly later than the movement of the train on the map. Clicking on a map where there is no live camera button will deselect the live camera.
