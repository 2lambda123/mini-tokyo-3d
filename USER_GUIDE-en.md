## Mini Tokyo 3D Overview

![Screenshot](public/images/screenshot1.jpg)

Mini Tokyo 3D is a real-time 3D map of public transportation in Tokyo. Trains in operation and airplanes that are arriving or departing are represented on a realistic 3D map with smooth animation. This is a “digital twin” that looks exactly like the real world in the digital world.

Users can freely move around on the 3D map and zoom in on the places they want to see to know the “now” of Tokyo. It can be used in various ways such as looking for the transfer route as a route map, checking the destination town and weather before going out, just watching the way along the railway by automatically tracking a train and judging if you should dash to not miss the final train from the current position of the train.

Mini Tokyo 3D is a web application that you can run in any web browser, regardless of device, such as PCs, smartphones, tablets, and set-top boxes. Please use the following URL to access.

The features of Mini Tokyo 3D are as follows.

### All in Real-Time

<img src="public/images/day-night.jpg" width="640">

You can view trains and airplanes that operate according to actual timetables and real-time delay information from your favorite point of view. The color of the scenery changes according to the sunrise and sunset times in Tokyo, and the sunset glow can be seen. In addition, a rain animation based on real-time weather information is displayed, so you can enjoy more realistic scenery.

### Easy-To-Read Railroad Map

<img src="public/images/transit.jpg" width="328">

Mini Tokyo 3D is using the same line colors used in official route maps and guidance, and arranges each railway at an appropriate interval according to the scale of the map to display the route in an easy-to-read form. If the names of two or more stations are different, but passengers can transfer from one to others, the connections between the stations are displayed to support smooth transfer. The shape of the train is a simple solid color cuboid that enhances symbolism.

### Operability and Performance

<img src="public/images/performance.jpg" width="537">

Over 1,200 trains run at the same time during the rush hour, but with the optimized data structure and processing logic, a very smooth operation animation is realized even on smartphones. Smooth animation of 60 frames per second is used everywhere, including viewpoint movement, switching between overground and underground views, and fading in and out of trains and airplanes.

### Support for 4 Languages

<img src="public/images/multilanguage.jpg" width="219">

In addition to Japanese, Mini Tokyo 3D supports English, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional) and Korean, which are popular with tourists visiting Japan. Not only the user interface texts but also railway names, station names, train types, airport names and airline names are also multilingualized. For the user interface texts, Thai and Nepali are also supported.

### Train Operation and Display as Close as Possible to Reality

<img src="public/images/reality.jpg" width="604">

Fine tuning of the starting acceleration and maximum speed of the trains was done repeatedly by getting on them, so that they would move in the same way as the actual trains. The underground tunnel sections of the overground railways and the overground sections of the subways are also completely reproduced.

### Switching Views Between Overground and Underground

<img src="public/images/shinjuku-overground.jpg" width="300"> <img src="public/images/shinjuku-underground.jpg" width="300">

The railway network in Tokyo is one of the most complex in the world. Mini Tokyo 3D is pursuing ease of viewing by switching between the overground and underground railway networks as well as clearly expressing subway train operations that are invisible in reality.

## Display Modes

### Full Screen Mode

<img src="public/images/fullscreen-icon.jpg" width="50">

Click or tap the screen zoom icon to toggle Full Screen Mode on or off.

When Full Screen Mode is on, you can cancel Full Screen Mode by pressing Esc key instead of clicking / tapping the button.

### Underground Mode

<img src="public/images/underground.jpg" width="662"> <img src="public/images/eye-icon.jpg" width="50" align="top">

Click or tap the eye icon button to turn Underground Mode on or off (the icon is in light blue when it is on).

When Underground Mode is on, the map will turn dark and overground railways, stations, trains and airplanes will be translucent, while underground railways, stations and trains will appear brighter.

When Underground Mode is off, the map will return to normal, overground railways, stations, trains and airplanes will be displayed brightly, and underground railways, stations and trains will be translucent.

You can also switch modes by clicking or tapping underground trains with Underground Mode off, or clicking or tapping overground trains with Underground Mode on. In addition, the mode is automatically switched when the train being tracked enters the underground from the ground or exits from the underground to the ground.

### Tracking Mode

<img src="public/images/helicopter-tracking.jpg" width="400"> <img src="public/images/helicopter-icon.jpg" width="50" align="top"> <img src="public/images/rear-tracking.jpg" width="400"> <img src="public/images/train-icon.jpg" width="50" align="top">

Click or tap on a train or airplane to turn Tracking Mode on and the screen will automatically follow the movement of the train or airplane (the icon will appear in light blue when it is on). Clicking on a map with no trains or airplanes turns Tracking Mode off.

The helicopter icon indicates the “Helicopter Tracking Mode”, and it makes a 360 degree turn around the target train or airplane. The train icon indicates the “Rear Tracking Mode”, and it tracks the direction of travel from diagonally behind the target train or airplane. Click or tap the icon button to toggle between the “Helicopter Tracking Mode” and the “Rear Tracking Mode”.

When the tracking mode is on, the timetable and current position of the train being tracked is displayed at the bottom of the screen. For the train connecting to other lines, the timetables of those lines are also shown. The timetable can be scrolled by using the mouse wheel, dragging the scroll bar, or dragging your finger. Click on the "∨" icon in the upper right corner of the timetable to hide the timetable at the bottom of the screen, or click on the "∧" icon to display it again.

### Playback Mode

<img src="public/images/playback-icon.jpg" width="50">

Click or tap the playback icon button to switch Playback Mode on or off (the icon is in light blue when it is on).

When Playback Mode is on, you can change the date and time and the speed at which time progresses, so you can check the operation of a train on a specific date and time, or enjoy the train operation throughout the entire day as if you were watching model trains in motion. In this state, trains will run according to the timetables and no real-time information will be reflected.

When Playback Mode is off, trains and airplanes are displayed on the map according to the actual operation at the current time. Because it uses real-time information, the location on the map will change accordingly if there is a train delay or flight schedule change.

When Playback Mode is turned on, the “Edit date & time” button and the “+” and “-” buttons to change the playback speed appear just below the time display. If you click or tap the “Edit date & time” button, you will enter the date/time editing mode. The “+” and “-” buttons appear above and below the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second numbers. Use these buttons to change the date and time, and click or tap the "OK" button to confirm the change. Clicking or tapping the "Cancel" button will cancel the change and return to the original setting time. You can also change the playback speed by clicking or tapping the “+” and “-” buttons on the left and right of the number that indicates the speed. It can be set to between 1x (the same speed as real time) and 600x, in increments of 1 from 1x to 10x, 10 from 10x to 100x, and 100 from 100x to 600x.
